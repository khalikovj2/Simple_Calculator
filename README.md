 📌 Project Title

Simple Calculator Application Using Java Swing

 📘 Introduction

This project is a simple calculator application built using Java's Swing framework. It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and provides a clean graphical user interface. The application demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as GUI development, event handling, and simple expression evaluation.

 🎯 Functionalities

* Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷)
* Handle decimal numbers
* Clear (C) button to reset the display
* Delete (←) button to remove the last character
* Result display using the equals (=) button
* Handles basic exceptions like divide-by-zero
* Responsive and user-friendly GUI

 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* Language: Java
* GUI Toolkit: Swing (Java Standard Library)
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* Java Version: Java SE 17

 💻 Application Overview

The calculator GUI includes:

* A non-editable display field for input and result
* A grid of buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and special functions like clear and delete
* A GridLayout to organize buttons similar to a real calculator

 ⚙️ How It Works

* Each button click triggers an ActionListener event.
* The app collects the input in a string builder and evaluates the result when the equals button is clicked.
* Basic input validation and exception handling are included to ensure correct behavior.



💬 Notes

This project helped reinforce my understanding of Java GUI development and event-driven programming. I encountered and solved several real-world issues like input validation, responsive layout design, and exception handling during development.
